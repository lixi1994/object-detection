# object-detection
Project 3 of CMPEN454 Computer Vision

The goal of this project is to implement the four simple motion detection algorithms:
  Simple Background Subtraction
  Simple Frame Differencing
  Adaptive Background Subtraction
  Persistent Frame Differencing

DataSets:
images for eight different video sequences

How to run:
  1. Change path in main.m to a specific video sequence.
  2. For the last two algorithms, tune parameter lambda, gamma to see difference.
  3. Run main.m to detect objects in your preferred video sequence by 4 algorithms.
